; any cell with fewer than 2 live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population
; any cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation
; any live cell with more than 3 live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding
; any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction

; count live neighbours
; use sets?
